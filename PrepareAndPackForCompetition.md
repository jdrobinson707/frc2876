# Prepare List #

Every year we need to do something like this.  There might be slight variations.

  * Upload code we want to use at competition to code.google.
  * Download latest code from code.google to two different laptops.
  * Make sure we have all the latest WPILib, FRC, firmware, versions downloaded to all laptops including classmate. Check 'season updates' section of FRC website/manual to see if any are needed.
  * make sure classmate laptop starts driver station and correct dashboard. The robot needs to be powered on to test that dashboard is ok.
