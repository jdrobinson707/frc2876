FRC Two Color Tracker Example
--------------------------------

This program is a sample program that implements two color 
tracking in the autonomous mode. It assumes that you are 
using a gimbal such as the one provided in the 2009 kit, 
with two servos on PWM 9 and 10.

This program follows a pink/green target during the 
Autonomous period. It looks for green above pink. To change to 
pink above green, modify the input parameter from ABOVE to BELOW.
Determination of alliance (pink/green order) is left as an
exercise for teams, either by mechanical means or input from the 
Driver Station. 

The Operator Control code is unchanged from the 
Simple Robot default.

version 3 - Released with update to WPILib. Removed TempInAare().
Also return ParticleAnalysisReports for both colors so average
target position can be determined. Added funcName to constructor.

Version 2 - Includes temporary version of InAreA() that can 
be removed when WPILib updates are published. Also adds
area to the ImageHit structure.

version 1 - Initial release
